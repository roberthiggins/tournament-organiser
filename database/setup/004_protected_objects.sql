/*
    Objects are protected with an ACL (access control list) pattern.

    If you want to control who can enter a game score for a tournament you
    might do the following:
        - add an entry to the protected_object table.
        - reference this from the tournament table. Permissions can now be
          added to that tournament.
        - Create a row in protected_object_action called 'enter_game_score' (if
          a suitable action didn't exist already)
        - Create a row in protected_object_permission that references
          protected_object_action and protected_object. This is essentially an
          instance object representing permission to 'enter_game_score' for
          your tournament.
        - Create a row in account_protected_object_permission to link an
          account with the protected_object_permission row above.
