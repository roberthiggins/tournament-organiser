# The container doesn't have a working db as we might wish to set passwords,
# etc. at runtime. So we create the actual db here. This script will be run as
# the entrypoint to the image.

# Create a PostgreSQL role named ``docker`` with default password and
# then create a database `to-db` owned by the ``docker`` role. Then fill that
# database from the files in the setup directory.
# IMPORTANT ASSUMPTION: We assume that all the files in the setup dir are
# ordered correctly. This can be done by prefixing a number to the filename.
