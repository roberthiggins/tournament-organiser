Feature: Interact with missions through the API
    I want to be able to get and set missions for a tournament
    As a TO
    So that that players can get mission information without me on the day

    Background: I log in
        Given I am on "/login"
        Then I fill in "id_inputUsername" with "charlie_murphy"
        Then I fill in "id_inputPassword" with "password"
        Then I press "Login"
        Then I POST "tournamentId=mission_test&numRounds=3" to "/setRounds" from the API
        Then the API response status code should be 200
        Then I POST "tournamentId=mission_test&missions=[%22mission_1%22,%22mission_2%22,%22mission_3%22]" to "/setMissions" from the API
        Then the API response status code should be 200

    Scenario: I want to get a list of missions for the tournament
        When I GET "/getMissions/mission_test" from the API
        Then the API response status code should be 200
        Then the response is JSON
        Then the API response should contain "mission_1"
        Then the API response should contain "mission_2"
        Then the API response should contain "mission_3"

    Scenario: I want to get the mission for a single round
        # Get the nth element in the list returned getMissions

    Scenario Outline: I want to set the missions for a tournament
        When I POST "<value>" to "/setMissions" from the API
        Then the API response status code should be <code>
        When I GET "/getMissions/mission_test" from the API
        Then the API response should contain "<first_mission>"

        Examples:
            | value                                                                             | code  | first_mission |
            | tournamentId=mission_test                                                         | 400   | mission_1     |
            | missions=[%22foo%22,%22bar%22,%22baz%22]                                          | 400   | mission_1     |
            | tournamentId=mission_test&missions=[%22bar%22,%22baz%22]                          | 400   | mission_1     |
            | tournamentId=mission_test&missions=[%22bar%22,%22baz%22,%22boo%22,%22boo%22]      | 400   | mission_1     |
            | tournamentId=mission_test&missions=[%22foo%22,%22bar%22,%22baz%22]                | 200   | foo           |
            | tournamentId=mission_test&missions=[%22boo%22,%22boo%22,%22boo%22]                | 200   | boo           |

    Scenario: I add some missions but then change the number of rounds
        Given I POST "tournamentId=mission_test&numRounds=2" to "/setRounds" from the API
        Then the API response status code should be 200
        Then I POST "tournamentId=mission_test&numRounds=3" to "/setRounds" from the API
        Then the API response status code should be 200
        Given I am on "setmissions/mission_test"
        Then the "id_missions_0" field should contain "mission_1"
        Then the "id_missions_1" field should contain "mission_2"
        Then the "id_missions_2" field should not contain "mission_3"
        Then the "id_missions_2" field should contain "TBA"
