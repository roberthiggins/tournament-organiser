# Prod install script for Tournament Organiser.
#
# This will make sure the prod settings are configured properly
#
# To do a prod install you need to run this file on prod
#
# This will run all the tests that don't affect the db
#
# What you need:
#       - CHECK there is a file at docker-passwords.yml It should contain
#       passwords. THIS WILL NOT BE CHECKED IN!!!
#       You should scp it from your home machine.
#
# Using the existing db:
#       - If you would like to use the existing db info you just need to make
#       sure the prod compose file includes a "volumes_from" pointing at dbstore
