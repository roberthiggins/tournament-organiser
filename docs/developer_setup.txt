h1. Developing the Website

h2. Initial packages you'll need
* sudo apt-get install -y git pylint
* go install docker and docker-compose - see their website

h3. Bandwidth
The initial build will require a lot of guff to be downloaded (~2GB maybe).

h2. Setup
* Get the config file. This might include passwords so is not included in git
(as that would go to github). You should get this from Higgins/an adult
* ./scripts/test
* You are done. To do it manually see the script; it's pretty straight-forward.
