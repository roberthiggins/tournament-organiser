Ranking Strategies

Tournaments will have a way to order their players based on the scores they
have. This will vary from tournament to tournament.

The default here is RankingStrategy. It is the null strategy so it will just
return lists in the order they were handed in and will pick the first db entry
as the winner of any given category.
